# weather-dashboard


the following project was created in an effort to meet the following criteria:

-GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
-WHEN I search for a city
-THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
-WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
-THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
-WHEN I view the UV index
-THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
-WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
-THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
-WHEN I click on a city in the search history
-THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

a weather API was used to retrieve necessary weather data, as well as JS,CSS,HTML working in conjunction to provide the proper layout. Bootstrap was also used as well as Moment.js to allow proper styling and time retrieval to convert unix time into modernized timeframes.
